Beginner level coding and practice using GitHub


Entry 1:

This is my first entry with GitHub. I am a beginner level coder and I'm eager to learn more. I'm not sure what type of work I will upload, but we shall see. I'm trying to learn the importance of coding in everyday applications and the best uses of different languages.
